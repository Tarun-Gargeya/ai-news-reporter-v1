0295655d-81ab-4fdf-a7d2-c4661cabe311.jpg,"**BOTH SIDES CONFIRMED THE HALT AFTER A KEY TRANSIT DEAL EXPIRED**

**Russia and Ukraine cease five decades of gas transit to EU**

• Ukraine to give up long-held strategic position

**PRISCILA AZEVEDO ROCHA, DANIEL HORNAK & ANNA SHIRYAEVSKAYA**
January 1

RUSSIAN GAS STOPPED flowing to Europe via Ukraine, closing off a route that’s operated for five decades after Kyiv refused to allow any transit that funds Moscow’s war machine.

Both sides confirmed the halt on Wednesday after a key transit deal expired. The stoppage means central European countries that have relied on the flows will be forced to source more expensive gas elsewhere, compounding pressure on supplies just as the region depletes winter storage at the fastest pace in years.

While the route accounts for just 5% of Europe’s needs, nations are still reeling from the aftershocks of an energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. Gas prices are up 50% year-on-year, getting a boost in recent weeks from the looming cutoff in supply. The continent is now increasingly exposed to market volatility as it becomes more reliant on global liquefied natural gas.

For Russia, the loss of one of its two remaining gas-pipeline routes to Europe will slash revenue by about $6 billion a year, Bloomberg calculations show. Ukraine will also miss out on transit fees and give up its long-held strategic position as a conduit of affordable energy for Western allies.

“This termination of gas transit is not just a supply-chain adjustment – it’s the symbolic collapse of an era,” said Tatiana Mitrova, a researcher at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “A significant part of the Soviet-built gas-pipeline network, which once brought Siberian gas to Europe, is now a shadow of its former self.” Most central European customers of Russia’s Gazprom PJSC have managed to source alternative supplies, but at a higher cost.

Slovakia’s largest gas utility, Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS, said it will pay about €90 million ($93 million) more a year to guarantee stable imports through different routes.

It also warned that in the event of a cold winter, all of Europe has been left more vulnerable.

**Deal Ends**

Gazprom halted supplies on New Year’s Day after the five-year transit deal expired, citing a lack of “technical and legal opportunities” for shipments amid “repeated and explicit refusal of the Ukrainian side to extend these agreements.” The stop was confirmed by Ukraine’s Energy Ministry, which said Russian flows across its territory ceased as of 7 a.m. local time.

While there’s no risk of an immediate shortfall in Europe, the stoppage may make stockpiling more challenging ahead of the next heating season. The region’s inventories have been shrinking rapidly and are now below 75% full. With Russia’s piped flows to Europe diminished, President Vladimir Putin will likely double down on efforts to boost LNG shipments, long a personal ambition.

Despite calls by some European countries to ban liquefied gas supplies from Moscow, the region is buying record amounts.

Russia’s further LNG expansion faces a wall of Western sanctions, though US President-elect Donald Trump may seek to alter penalties amid any potential efforts to end the war.

Across Europe, the loss of some crucial Russian piped gas threatens to drive up bills for households and industry as they strive to recover from the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades.
